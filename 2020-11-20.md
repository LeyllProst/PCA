**1.** Because you do not know every possible future use for the data TerramEarth collects, you have decided to build a system that captures and stores all raw data in case you need it later. How can you most cost-effectively accomplish this goal?
B. Have the vehicles in the field pass the data to Cloud Pub/Sub and dump it into a Cloud Dataproc cluster that stores data in Apache Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS) on persistent disks.

**2.** Today, TerramEarth maintenance workers receive interactive performance graphs for the last 24 hours (86,400 events) by plugging their maintenance tablets into the vehicle. The support group wants support technicians to view this data remotely to help troubleshoot problems. You want to minimize the latency of graph loads. How should you provide this functionality?
D. Execute queries against BigQuery with data stored in Cloud Storage via BigQuery federation.

**3.** Your agricultural division is experimenting with fully autonomous vehicles. You want your architecture to promote strong security during vehicle operation. Which two architecture characteristics should you consider? (choose two)
E. Treat every microservice call between modules on the vehicle as untrusted.
F. Use a Trusted Platform Module (TPM) and verify firmware and binaries on boot

**4.** Which of TerramEarth’s legacy enterprise processes will experience significant change as a result of increased Google Cloud Platform adoption?
A. OpEx/CapEx allocation, LAN change management, capacity planning

**5.** You analyzed TerramEarth’s business requirement to reduce downtime and found that they can achieve a majority of time saving by reducing customers’ wait time for parts. You decided to focus on reduction of the 3 weeks’ aggregate reporting time. Which modifications to the company’s processes should you recommend?
C. Increase fleet cellular connectivity to 80%, migrate from FTP to streaming transport, and develop machine learning analysis of metrics.

**6.** Your company wants to deploy several microservices to help their system handle elastic loads. Each microservice uses a different version of software libraries. You want to enable their developers to keep their development environment in sync with the various production services. Which technology should you choose?
B. Containers

**7.** Your company wants to track whether someone is present in a meeting room reserved for a scheduled meeting. There are 1000 meeting rooms across 5 offices on 3 continents. Each room is equipped with a motion sensor that reports its status every second. You want to support the data ingestion needs of this sensor network. The receiving infrastructure needs to account for the possibility that the devices may have inconsistent connectivity. Which solution should you design?
C. Have devices poll for connectivity to Cloud Pub/Sub and publish the latest messages on a regular interval to a shared topic for all devices.

**8.** Your company wants to try out the cloud with low risk. They want to archive approximately 100 TB of their log data to the cloud and test the serverless analytics features available to them there, while also retaining that data as a long-term disaster recovery backup. Which two steps should they take? (choose two)
A. Load logs into BigQuery.
E. Upload log files into Cloud Storage.

**9.** You set up an autoscaling managed instance group to serve web traffic for an upcoming launch. After configuring the instance group as a backend service to an HTTP(S) load balancer, you notice that virtual machine (VM) instances are being terminated and re-launched every minute. The instances do not have a public IP address. You have verified that the appropriate web response is coming from each instance using the curl command. You want to ensure that the backend is configured correctly. What should you do?
C. Ensure that a firewall rule exists to allow load balancer health checks to reach the instances in the instance group.

**10.** Your organization has a 3-tier web application deployed in the same Google Cloud Virtual Private Cloud (VPC). Each tier (web, API, and database) scales independently of the others. Network traffic should flow through the web to the API tier, and then on to the database tier. Traffic should not flow between the web and the database tier. How should you configure the network with minimal steps?
D. Add tags to each tier and set up firewall rules to allow the desired traffic flow.

**11.** You are designing a large distributed application with 30 microservices. Each of your distributed microservices needs to connect to a database backend. You want to store the credentials securely. Where should you store the credentials?
In a key management system

**12.** Mountkirk Games wants to set up a real-time analytics platform for their new game. The new platform must meet their technical requirements. Which combination of Google technologies will meet all of their requirements?
A. Kubernetes Engine, Cloud Pub/Sub, and Cloud SQL

**13.** Mountkirk Games has deployed their new backend on Google Cloud Platform (GCP). You want to create a thorough testing process for new versions of the backend before they are released to the public. You want the testing environment to scale in an economical way. How should you design the process?
A. Create a scalable environment in Google Cloud for simulating production load.

**14.** Mountkirk Games wants to set up a continuous delivery pipeline. Their architecture includes many small services that they want to be able to update and roll back quickly. Mountkirk Games has the following requirements: (1) Services are deployed redundantly across multiple regions in the US and Europe, (2) Only frontend services are exposed on the public internet, (3) They can reserve a single frontend IP for their fleet of services, and (4) Deployment artifacts are immutable. Which set of products should they use?
B. Cloud Storage, App Engine, Cloud Load Balancing

**15.** Your customer is moving their corporate applications to Google Cloud. The security team wants detailed visibility of all resources in the organization. You use Resource Manager to set yourself up as the Organization Administrator. Which Cloud Identity and Access Management (Cloud IAM) roles should you give to the security team while following Google recommended practices?
B. Organization viewer, Project viewer

**16.** To reduce costs, the Director of Engineering has required all developers to move their development infrastructure resources from on-premises virtual machines (VMs) to Google Cloud. These resources go through multiple start/stop events during the day and require state to persist. You have been asked to design the process of running a development environment in Google Cloud while providing cost visibility to the finance department. Which two steps should you take? (choose two)
A. Use persistent disks to store the state. Start and stop the VM as needed.
E. Store all state in a Local SSD, snapshot the persistent disks, and terminate the VM.

**17.** The database administration team has asked you to help them improve the performance of their new database server running on Compute Engine. The database is used for importing and normalizing the company’s performance statistics. It is built with MySQL running on Debian Linux. They have an n1-standard-8 virtual machine with 80 GB of SSD zonal persistent disk which they can't restart until the next maintenance event. What should they change to get better performance from this system as soon as possible and in a cost-effective manner?
D. Migrate their performance metrics warehouse to BigQuery.
